He lies there.\\n\\nA CHILD’S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE \\nBLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat \\na SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded \\nMan tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He \\nCOLLAPSES.\\n\\nThe barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A \\nJAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the \\nbeach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a \\ncliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.\\n\\nINT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER\\n\\nThe Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY \\nJAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.\\n\\nATTENDANT\\n\\n(in Japanese)\\n\\nHe was delirious. But he asked for \\nyou by name. And...\\n\\n(to the Security Guard)\\n\\nShow him.\\n\\nSECURITY GUARD\\n\\n(in Japanese)\\n\\nHe was carrying nothing but this...\\n\\nHe puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating.\\n\\n...and this.\\n\\nSECURITY GUARD\\n\\nThe Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the \\ngun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.\\n\\nELDERLY JAPANESE MAN\\n\\n(in Japanese)\\n\\nBring him here. And some food.\\n\\nINT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nThe Elderly Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down his food. \\nHe SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him.\\n\\nELDERLY JAPANESE MAN\\n\\n(in English)\\n\\nAre you here to kill me?\\n\\nThe Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his food.\\n\\n\\x0c2.\\n\\nThe Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and \\nforefinger.\\n\\nI know what this is.\\n\\nELDERLY JAPANESE MAN\\n\\nHe SPINS it onto a table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the \\npolished ebony... a SPINNING TOP.\\n\\nELDERLY JAPANESE MAN\\n\\nI’ve seen one before. Many, many \\nyears ago...\\n\\nThe Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top mesmerized.\\n\\nELDERLY JAPANESE MAN\\n\\nIt belonged to a man I met in a \\nhalf-remembered dream...\\n\\nMOVE IN on the GRACEFULLY SPINNING TOP...\\n\\nELDERLY JAPANESE MAN\\n\\nA man possessed of some radical \\nnotions...\\n\\nThe Elderly Japanese Man STARES, remembering... \\n\\nWhat’s the most resilient parasite?\\n\\nCOBB (V.O.)\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nINT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER)\\n\\nThe speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A young \\nJapanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens. \\n\\nA bacteria? A virus?\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nCobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass-\\n\\nAn intestinal worm?\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nSaito’s fork pauses, mid-air. Cobb GRINS. A third man is at \\nthe table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch- \\n\\nWhat Mr. Cobb is trying to say-\\n\\nARTHUR\\n\\nAn idea.\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nSaito looks at Cobb, curious.\\n\\n\\x0c3.\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nResilient, highly contagious. Once \\nan idea’s taken hold in the brain \\nit’s almost impossible to \\neradicate. A person can cover it \\nup, ignore it- but it stays there. \\n\\nSAITO\\nBut surely-to forget...?\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nInformation, yes. But an idea? \\nFully formed, understood? That \\nsticks...\\n\\n(taps forehead)\\n\\nIn there, somewhere.\\n\\nFor someone like you to steal?\\n\\nSAITO\\n\\nARTHUR\\n\\nYes. In the dream state, conscious \\ndefenses are lowered and your \\nthoughts become vulnerable to \\ntheft. It’s called extraction.\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nBut, Mr. Saito, we can train your \\nsubconscious to defend itself from \\neven the most skilled extractor.\\n\\nHow can you do that?\\n\\nSAITO\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nBecause I am the most skilled \\nextractor. I know how to search \\nyour mind and find your secrets. I \\nknow the tricks, and I can teach \\nthem to your subconscious so that \\neven when you’re asleep, your guard \\nis never down. \\n\\nCobb leans forwards. Holding Saito’s gaze.\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nBut if I’m going to help you, you \\nhave to be completely open to me. \\nI’ll need to know my way around \\nyour thoughts better than your \\nwife, your analyst, anyone. \\n\\n(gestures around)\\n\\nIf this is a dream and you’ve got a \\nsafe full of secrets, I need to \\nknow what’s in that safe. For this \\nto work, you have to let me in. \\n\\n\\x0c4.\\n\\nSaito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD \\nopens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY.\\n\\nSAITO\\n\\nGentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I \\nconsider your proposal.\\n\\nThey watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worried-\\n\\nHe knows.\\n\\nARTHUR\\n\\nCobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady their \\nglasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND IS \\nFROZEN.\\n\\nARTHUR\\nWhat’s going on up there?\\n\\nAnd we-\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nFILTHY BATHROOM - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)\\n\\nCobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING \\nBATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs \\nlevel with the rim of the tub.\\n\\nA sweating man (40\\'s) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. A \\ndistant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to the \\nwindow, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-WORLD \\nCITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.\\n\\nNash checks Cobb\\'s left wrist: above his watch, tape holds \\nTWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb\\'s watch- \\nTHE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.\\n\\nNash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur\\'s \\nfeet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the \\nbriefcase to Arthur\\'s wrist.\\n\\nNash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where \\nthey pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack of \\nthe door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to \\nhis wrist. BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and we-\\n\\nINT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)\\n\\nNash, ASLEEP. Head ROCKING AGAINST THE WINDOW as the train \\nBUMPS OVER A ROUGH PIECE OF TRACK.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\n\\x0c5.\\n\\nA Japanese Man, TODASHI (18) watches Nash nervously. He \\nchecks Nash\\'s wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREE \\nOTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO.\\n\\nTodashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME. \\nAnother TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with a MIGHTY \\nWHUMP− Todashi\\'s eyes FLY to Nash\\'s sleeping face-\\n\\nNASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and we-\\n\\nINT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nAnother EXPLOSION- Nash CHECKS the sleeping Cobb and we-\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nEXT. ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT\\n\\nA LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthur \\nsteady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and \\npieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. Other \\nGUESTS wander the massive terraces.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nSaito knows. He\\'s playing with us.\\n\\nARTHUR\\n\\nCOBB\\nI can get it here. The \\ninformation\\'s in the safe− he \\nlooked right at it when I mentioned \\nsecrets.\\n\\nArthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb\\'s shoulder.\\n\\nARTHUR \\nWhat\\'s she doing here, Cobb?\\n\\nCobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed, \\nstaring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her.\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nYou just get to your room. I\\'ll \\ntake care of the rest.\\n\\nARTHUR\\n\\nSee that you do. We\\'re here to \\nwork.\\n\\nArthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb. \\nLooks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR-\\n\\nIf I jumped, would I survive?\\n\\nMAL \\n\\n\\x0c6.\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nWith a clean dive, perhaps. Mal, \\nwhy are you here?\\n\\nShe turns to look at him. Amused.\\n\\nMAL\\n\\nI thought you might be missing \\nme...\\n\\nShe smiles. He leans in, mesmerized.\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nI am. But I can\\'t trust you \\nanymore.\\n\\nShe stares up at him, inviting.\\n\\nSo what?\\n\\nMAL\\n\\nINT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nMal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Francis \\nBacon.\\n\\nMAL \\nLooks like Arthur\\'s taste.\\n\\nCobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS \\npatrolling the castle at ground level.\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nActually, Mr. Saito is partial to \\npostwar British painters.\\n\\nHe turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.\\n\\nWould you sit down?\\n\\nCOBB \\n\\nMal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair. \\nCobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels \\nat Mal\\'s feet. She looks down at him.\\n\\nTell me...\\n\\nMAL\\n\\nCobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.\\n\\nMAL \\nDo the children miss me?\\n\\nCobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal\\'s \\nankle. He looks up at her.\\n\\n\\x0cYou can\\'t imagine.\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nMal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, letting \\nout the rope as he moves back to the window.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nWhat\\'re you doing? \\n\\nMAL\\n\\nCobb tosses the rope out-\\n\\nGetting some air.\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nHe tugs on the rope, testing. The weight of the chair, with \\nMal on it, holds.\\n\\nStay seated. Please.\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nAnd with that, he JUMPS. Mal considers the open window.\\n\\nEXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nCobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows. He stops at \\na particular one. Gets out a glass cutter-\\n\\nSuddenly he starts DROPPING-\\n\\nINT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nThe EMPTY CHAIR SLIDES across the floor- WEDGES under the \\nwindow-\\n\\nEXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nCobb JOLTS to a stop 15 ft. lower. He looks up at the bedroom \\nwindow. Shakes his head. Starts climbing back.\\n\\nINT. KITCHEN, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nCobb drops silently from the window into the darkened \\nkitchen. He pulls a PISTOL from his belt, screwing a SILENCER \\nonto the barrel as he GLIDES across the room.\\n\\nINT. HALL, JAPANESE CASTLE-CONTINUOUS\\n\\nCobb SLIPS through the shadows towards a GUARD stationed at \\nthe head of a GRAND STAIRCASE...\\n\\nThe Guard HEARS something- TURNS- PEERS into the shadows...\\n\\nCobb FLASHES out of the shadows, silenced pistol up, AIMING-\\n\\n\\x0c8.\\n\\nPHHT- head shot- the Guard starts to drop... but Cobb is \\nalready there to CATCH him, sliding on his knees and lowering \\nthe Guard SILENTLY to the floor.\\n\\nINT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nCobb moves to a PAINTING. With practiced hands he removes it \\nfrom the wall, revealing a SAFE. Cobb spins the dial, pulls \\nit OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it into his \\nwaistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVELOPE.\\n\\nLIGHTS COME ON. Cobb freezes.\\n\\nTurn around.\\n\\nSAITO (O.S.)\\n\\nCobb turns. At the far end of the room: Saito. Next to him is \\nMal, gun in hand. She smiles at Cobb.\\n\\nMAL\\nThe gun, Dom.\\n\\nCobb doesn\\'t move. Mal motions outside- two GUARDS drag \\nArthur into the room. Mal puts the gun to his head.\\n\\nPlease.\\n\\nMAL\\n\\nCobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then \\nSLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to rest HALFWAY \\ndown the length or the table.\\n\\nSAITO \\nNow the envelope, Mr. Cobb.\\n\\nCobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the \\nenvelopes, SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, hands \\nraised. \\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nDid she tell you, or have you known \\nall along?\\n\\nSAITO\\n\\nThat you\\'re here to steal from me? \\n\\n(beat)\\n\\nOr that we\\'re actually asleep?\\n\\nArthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look.\\n\\nSAITO\\n\\nI want to know who your employer \\nis.\\n\\nMal COCKS the gun at Arthur\\'s temple.\\n\\n\\x0c9.\\n\\nCOBB\\n\\nNo point threatening him in a \\ndream.\\n\\nMAL\\n\\nThat depends on what you\\'re \\nthreatening. Killing him would just \\nwake him up... but pain? Pain is in \\nthe mind...\\n\\nMal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the leg- Arthur \\ndrops, SCREAMING- Mal looks at Cobb, cold.\\n\\nMAL\\n\\nAnd, judging by the decor, we\\'re in \\nyour mind, aren\\'t we, Arthur?\\n\\nCobb watches Arthur\\'s PAIN. Mal aims at Arthur\\'s other leg...\\n\\nCobb SPRINGS for the table, SKIDDING along its polished \\nsurface- he GRABS his gun- SHOOTS ARTHUR BETWEEN THE EYES-\\n\\nArthur DROPS- the room starts to SHUDDER in a MASSIVE \\nEARTHQUAKE− Cobb SPRINGS for the door- Arthur\\'s eyes stare at \\nthe ceiling, DEAD, and we-\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nINT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY\\n\\nArthur\\'s EYES OPEN as he WAKES IN THE ARMCHAIR- he GRABS at \\nthe tubes at his wrist, YANKING them free-\\n\\nWhat\\'re you doing?! It\\'s too soon-\\n\\nNASH \\n\\nFLUID spurts from the tubes as Arthur STRUGGLES with the \\nSILVER CASE on the bathroom floor.\\n\\nARTHUR\\n\\nI know! We have to reconnect the \\nloop before they wake up!\\n\\nArthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the \\nbedroom− following the tubes to where they meet Saito\\'s wrist- \\nSAITO LIES ON THE BED ASLEEP. Saito STIRS and we-\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nINT. JAPANESE CASTLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT\\n\\nCobb LURCHES towards the stairs, as all around him the \\nbuilding BUCKS and HEAVES-\\n\\n\\x0c10.\\n\\nINT.

GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nAs Cobb runs up the stairs he reads the TYPEWRITTEN SHEETS \\nfrom his envelope, and we-\\n\\nINT.

DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nCobb, wet but composed, sits, turning Saito\\'s gun in his \\nhand. Nash holds Saito\\'s arms behind him.
